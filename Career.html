	<h1>Career Plans and Interests</h1>

	<h2>General Interests:</h2>
	<p>
		Currently my favorite topics in computer science and engineering lie in quantum computing, deep neural networks, and analysis of algorithms. This is quite the broad spectrum, but I am currently a freshman and have not narrowed down my interests to a single topic just yet. I also enjoy studying phsyics in my freetime, reading things like Richard Feynman's <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> and Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i>. I personally find modern physics very interesting, which is why my current favroite area of interest lies in quantum computing, a fantastic collaboration between, among other things, physics and computer science.

	<h2>Current Career Plans (Very Tentative):</h2>
	<p>Being only a freshman in college, my career plans are also not quite set in stone. Currently, I would really like to pursue a PhD in any of the following fields: Physics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering. However, for logistical reasons, I know that getting a PhD can be very difficult. Because of this, I could also see myself entering industry after graduating and spending some time as a software engineer. However, I believe that my calling is to obtain a higher education. Ultimately, I hope to one day get a graduate degree, whether it be immediately after undegraduate studies, or after several years in industry.</p>
