			<h2 style="margin-left: 5px">General Interests:</h2>
			<p style="margin-left: 5px">
				Currently my favorite topics in computer science and engineering lie in quantum computing, deep neural networks, and analysis of algorithm boundary conditions. I also have recently taken up an interest in mathematics. I am currently very interested in differential geometry (as it applies to general relativity) and complex analysis. I also still enjoy studying physics in my freetime, reading things like Richard Feynman's <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> and Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i>. I personally find modern physics and mathematics very interesting, which is why my current favroite area of interest lies in quantum computing, a fantastic collaboration between, among other things, physics, math, and computer science.

			<h2 style="margin-left: 5px">Current Career Plans (Very Tentative):</h2>
			<p style="margin-left: 5px">
				Being only a junior in college, my career plans are also not quite set in stone. Currently, I would really like to pursue a PhD in any of the following fields: Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics. However, for many reasons, I know that getting a PhD can be very difficult. Because of this, I could also see myself entering industry after graduating and spending some time as a software engineer. Ultimately, I currently wish to obtain a graduate-level education, whether it be immediately after undegraduate studies, or after several years in industry.
