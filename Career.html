	<h2>General Interests:</h2>
	<p>
		Currently my favorite topics in computer science and engineering lie in quantum computing, deep neural networks, and analysis of algorithm boundary conditions. I also am interested in the usage of local geometries to approximate multidimensional data spaces. This is quite the broad spectrum, but I am currently only a rising sophomore and have not narrowed down my interests to a single topic just yet. I also enjoy studying physics in my freetime, reading things like Richard Feynman's <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i> and Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i>. I personally find modern physics very interesting, which is why my current favroite area of interest lies in quantum computing, a fantastic collaboration between, among other things, physics and computer science.

	<h2>Current Career Plans (Very Tentative):</h2>
	<p>Being only a rising sophomore in college, my career plans are also not quite set in stone. Currently, I would really like to pursue a PhD in any of the following fields: Physics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering. However, for many reasons, I know that getting a PhD can be very difficult. Because of this, I could also see myself entering industry after graduating and spending some time as a software engineer. Ultimately, I currently wish to obtain a graduate-level education, whether it be immediately after undegraduate studies, or after several years in industry.</p>
